# Surfs_up

## Overview
The purpose of this module is to find pertinent information regarding the weather to better understand W. Avy's business plans. Specifically, we found the summary statistics for June and December's temperatures. In this module, students learned how to use querys, create dataframes, and generate summary statistics using sql.

## Results

### June
* June had a mean temperature of 74.94 degrees with a minimum of 64 and maximum of 85 degrees.

* June's standard deviation was 3.26
### December
* December had a lower mean temperature of 71.04 degrees with a minimum of 56 and maximum of 83 degrees.

* December had a higher standard deviation being 3.75.
## Summary

In conclusion, W. Avy should be sceptical about opening the surf shop in December due to more volatile weather that does allow for much surfing. It may be worth opening the shop if many surfers prepare for the season around that time. For example, buying new boards or boardshorts during this time. In order to conduct further analysis, it would be interesting to create a query that compares high tide and low tide temperatures to see how good the weather can be during ideal surfing times. Another query could be made to eliminate temperature's counted during the night because there will not be much surfing during this time.
